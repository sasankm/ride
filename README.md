## Problem
Create a simple web-app to display a map with all state parks displayed as pins on the map. Pins on map should be clickable. On clicking a pin, info details should be displayed about the park like name, timings, address, etc. Use react and feel free to design your UX design. Submit your project using GitHub.

Note: Provide clear instructions to run the code. Try limiting to just a single state in united states. Free to create a static data file or use free hosted data


Good to have: Search functionality


## Steps to run the application

### Go to your CLI and type the following commands:

1. Clone the directory from github.
2. cd <downloaded-directory-name>.
3. yarn install.
4. yarn start.
  (If you get an error liks this 'Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0' please type "unset HOST" and then step 4.)
